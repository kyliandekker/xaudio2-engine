# Undefiant Audio (UAUDIO)

This is a personal project of mine which I have been working on during my second year at Breda University of Applied Sciences. It uses XAudio2 and has its own conversion and effects. Currently it only supports wav.

## Usage

The engine itself can be used anywhere and it just needs to be compiled into a lib file and the include files need to be moved.

The repository comes with a showcase project that uses ImGui and SDL. Most of the features are shown in there.
