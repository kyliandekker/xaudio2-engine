# TODO

- [ ] SoundSheet in audio framework.
- [X] Make vectors and other std data structures use the allocator.
- [X] Make malloc and stuff use the allocator.
- [ ] Add a shit ton of ASSERTs.
- [ ] Invalid sizes in unit test for mono to stereo and reverse.
- [ ] Byte volume unit test.
- [ ] conversion unit test.
- [X] Set looping point and starting point (with custom slider). https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/76
- [X] Wave settings (load specific chunks only).
- [X] Fix 32-bit conversion.
- [X] Fix 24-bit conversion.
- [X] Close when loop crash.
- [X] Play multiple channels crash.
- [X] Volume and panning templated (so that 32bit and 24bit also works).
- [X] Volume and panning independent from types.
- [ ] 8-bit support.
- [X] Replace all Hash to DEFAULT_HASH.
- [X] Save wave file (needs recalc).

- [X] Loop point in config.
- [X] Clean up the conversion code (maybe move it elsewhere).
- [ ] Fix loop points now not being set because of conversion.
- [ ] Fix memory leak somewhere in removing.
- [ ] Unit tests for size calculations in conversion.
